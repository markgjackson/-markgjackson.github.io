Dear Studio Marketing Executives,

You will be hearing from many presenters suggesting ways to predict movie revenue based on properties of the movie. But to see if the predictions turn out to be true will take several weeks, and by then it may be too late! Thus I would like to present some work that I have been doing to predict movie revenues based on the first few weeks’ return. This prediction is based on the weekly evolution of the revenue.

<h2>Movie Revenue Model:  Exponentially Decaying Viewers</h2>

When a movie is released, sales usually start out strong then attract less viewers as time goes by. Eventually there are so few new viewers that the studio pulls the movie from theaters. The revenue versus week appears to fit an exponential curve of the form:


Figure 1 shows an example; this is not unusual, this is literally the first movie considered. We can get a better estimate of how exponential the revenue is by re-writing this as



An exactly exponential revenue curve will then yield a straight line with slope lambda. For this example,   


meaning that each week gets only 56% of the previous week’s viewers

<h2>Why is this Important?</h2>

If this exponential behavior is universal, the total revenue a movie will produce could be estimated from just the first weekend’s revenue, using an average decay:
